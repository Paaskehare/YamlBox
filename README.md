##YamlBox
#### A YAML Preprocessor for the openbox menu written in python3

**YamlBox** allows you to manage your `menu.xml` file for OpenBox in Yaml instead of the ordinary XML file structure.  
  
It is written for python3, although fallback support for python2 is planned.

Example Yaml Config structure is included.

**Planned Features**:  
- Python2 Support  
- XML Config to Yaml Config parsing, for converting your existing menu.xml file  

**Requirements**:  
- libyaml *(optionally, but preferred)*  
- python-yaml
